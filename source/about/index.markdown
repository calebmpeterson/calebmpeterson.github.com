My name is Caleb Peterson and I'm a software developer currently residing in the DFW Metroplex. I work for [BNSF Railway](http://www.bnsf.com) developing train movement planning and traffic simulation and analysis software.  I studied at Texas Tech University in the College of Engineering for 5 1/2 years, and while there I earned two Bachelor's of Science degrees: a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.

While at Texas Tech, I spent a semester working in the Virtual Reality Lab under Dr. Bharti Temkin [studying the application of haptic interfaces to medical simulation systems](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/communications/vistas/archive/05-spring/stories/virtual-reality.php).  Another summer working on real-time digital audio signal processing as an intern in Department of Electrical Engineering.  I also spent two years work as a software developer and hardware tester for Celeritous Technical Services.  During my last three semesters of school, I worked as part-time consultant for [South Plains Precision Ag](http://www.southplainsprecisionag.com) in Plainview, TX. The summer before my final semester at Texas Tech, I interned with BNSF Railway.

After graduating, I took a full-time position with BNSF Railway.  When I'm not working or spending time with my wife and children, I enjoy learning programming languages, practicing user interface design, studying a little math, and reading science fiction with a sprinkling of history and philosophy.  I've also been known to do a little freelance web design and implementation (primarily for friends and family).

**Cubicle 6** represents both my portfolio of personal projects as well as any freelance work I've done.
