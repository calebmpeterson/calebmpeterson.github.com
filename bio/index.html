            Caleb has loved building things since age two when his parents gave
            him his first Lego set. He has loved computers since his father paid
            him to learn to touch type on the family’s Apple//e at the age of
            six. He has loved programming, especially graphics programming,
            since age 15 when he accidentally enrolled in a high school computer
            science course.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Most importantly, Caleb has loved people and building tools which
            make their lives better since becoming a Christian at age 18. The
            command to “love your neighbor as yourself” is still applicable
            amidst the high technology of the 21st century.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Caleb's love for both people and software has lead him to focus on
            user interfaces for the majority of his career. His desire to
            purposefully deliver the best experience possible has lead him to
            increasingly focus on the adjacent field of user experience.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            While in University, Caleb worked as an embedded systems developer,
            spent a semester studying in the Computer Science department's
            virtual reality lab, and a Summer writing real-time signal
            processing software as part of the Electrical Engineering
            department's undergraduate Intern program.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Caleb spent his last year of school consulting for a precision
            agriculture company and was a Summer intern in BNSF Railway’s
            technology department. He worked at BNSF Railway for a little more
            than a decade contributing to a variety of train schedule planning
            tool suites for internal and external customers.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">

          <p class="lead">
            Caleb is one of less than 10,000 of Human Factors International
            Certified Usability Analysts and is as comfortable interviewing and
            observing users as he is designing and developing user interfaces.
